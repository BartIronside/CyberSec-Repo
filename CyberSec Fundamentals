🔐 CIANA – Cybersecurity Fundamentals

Cybersecurity is built upon a set of core principles, commonly represented by the acronym **CIANA**: 
**Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Non-repudiation**, and **Authenticity**. 
These five pillars guide how we secure data, systems, and communications.

C - 🕵️‍♂️ Confidentiality - This pillar refers to the information security. Confidentiality ensures that 
sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. 
It's about protecting data from unauthorized disclosure and keeping it private.

        **Example mechanisms:**  
        - Encryption (e.g., AES, TLS)
        - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
        - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
        - VPNs and tunneling protocols

**Example:**
        
Using HTTPS on a website ensures that data transmitted between the user and the server is encrypted and cannot be read by third parties.


I - 🧬 Integrity - Integrity refers to the accuracy and completeness of data. 
It ensures that data has not been tampered with or altered either accidentally or 
maliciously during storage or transmission.

        **Example mechanisms:**  
        - Checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA-256)
        - Digital signatures
        - Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
        - Version control systems


A - 🌐 Availability - Availability guarantees that authorized users have reliable and timely access to 
data, applications, and systems when needed. It involves designing infrastructure to resist or recover 
quickly from disruptions.


        **Example mechanisms:**  
        - Redundancy and failover systems
        - Load balancing
        - DDoS protection
        - Backups and disaster recovery plans




N - ✍️ Non-repudiation - Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin and delivery of data, 
        ensuring that a sender cannot deny having sent a message or performed an action. 
        It is critical for accountability and legal compliance.

        **Example mechanisms:**  
        - Digital signatures
        - Secure logging and audit trails
        - Email receipt confirmations
        - Blockchain-based transaction logs


A - 🔑 Authenticity - Authenticity ensures that the source of data or a user is genuine 
and that the information is not counterfeit. It often works hand-in-hand with authentication mechanisms.


        **Example mechanisms:**  
        - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
        - Digital certificates (e.g., X.509)
        - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
        - Biometrics and secure tokens
